## Provenance Bundle

This repository includes the file [`provenance_bundle.zip`](provenance_bundle.zip), which contains provenance tracking metadata for the project.

### Contents
- Cryptographic hashes (SHA256) of all key files  
- Generation timestamps  
- Versioning and linked DOIs  
- License and verification signatures  

### Purpose
The bundle serves as a **certificate of authenticity**:  
- Proves that the files published here are consistent with those deposited on Zenodo/DOI  
- Ensures traceability and reproducibility of results  
- Adds a layer of security and transparency for anyone validating the research

### Note
The `provenance_bundle` is **not required** for running the code or reproducing the simulations, but it is included as a reference for the scientific community to guarantee **verifiable integrity** of the project.
